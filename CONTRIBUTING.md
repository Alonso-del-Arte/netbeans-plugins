I think I will open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021.

# Guidelines for Hacktoberfest 2021 Contributors

I will definitely consider pull requests associated with an issue and maybe consider pull requests associated with a TODO (considered an Action Item in NetBeans).

Contributors should have a proper Java IDE (most are available for free) and JUnit. This project uses Java 8 and JUnit 4. Contributors may use later versions of Java provided they don't use features not available in Java 8. Using JUnit 4 should be no problem in an IDE that also has JUnit 5 (e.g., IntelliJ).

However, given the nature of this project, contributors should use NetBeans. I'm using NetBeans 11, you may use NetBeans 12.

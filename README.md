# NetBeans Plugins
Workbench for plugins that I will eventually propose be added to Apache NetBeans

The Apache NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE) is mostly used for Java. It can also be used for PHP, C++, Fortran, etc.

It's a very good IDE, in my opinion. But, like most programs, it could use some improvements, some more urgent than others.
